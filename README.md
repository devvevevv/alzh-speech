# Non-Invasive Alzheimer's Disease Detection Through Speech Analysis

A deep learning system that analyzes speech patterns to detect Alzheimer's Disease. This tool provides early, non-invasive screening using neural networks and natural language processing.

## Overview
Alzheimer's disease affects over 50 million people worldwide, with numbers expected to double by 2050. Early detection is crucial but challenging through traditional methods. This project leverages the fact that speech patterns change in early-stage Alzheimer's, offering a breakthrough approach to early diagnosis.
